---INGREDIENTS---

200 g rich tea or digestive biscuits vegan
200 g dark chocolate
100 g coconut oil
100 g maple syrup
50 g walnuts/ goji berries

---INSTRUCTIONS---

Put the dark chocolate in a bain-marie together with the coconut oil and melt. Once melted, remove from the heat, add the maple syrup in and mix well. Leave this bowl on the bain marie to keep it liquid.
Line a 2lb loaf tin with baking parchment and break up the biscuits into pieces.
Roughly chop the walnuts into small bite sized pieces and add to the cookies in the tin. Pour the chocolate over them and spread so that all the cookies are covered.
Leave to cool and for quickest results, put in the freezer but the fridge also works well.
